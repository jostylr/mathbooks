This is a book about mathematics. It is hoped that this will be both illuminating and inspiring. 

The goal is to go over typical math content in such a way that it is direct, clear, approachable, and succinct. In particular, every effort has been made to not pad in the space. 

Each chapter may have an assortment of different thoughts in it:

* Humble. What is it about and how might we use it? 
* Mnemonics. How can we remember it?
* Tools. What can we use to get the job done and what are the downsides?
* Pebbles. Any little exploratory bits we can play with?
* Applications. Where is this used?
* Programming. How can we program this stuff up?
* Cheat Sheet. Can we just get the facts please?
* Proofs. Why is this true?
