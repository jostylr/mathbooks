# Counting

Counting is the the start of mathematics and is something of inherent use to everyone. So let's begin with counting. By the end we will have the notion of a set all nice and understood. 

This is intended for people who already know how to count. It is more of a reflection on counting rather than an introduction which is generally done informally while growing up surrounded by people who count lots of stuff. 

## Humble

What is the core of counting? There are two aspects to it. One is a numbering and one is a sense of more than. 

The numbering starts off by examples. Having one penny, two pennies, three pennies, ..., ten pennies, a hundred pennies, ...  and so on, tells us how many pennies we have. If we had a hundred pennies, we could start removing them and count down to zero, when we have none. 

When I say "three pennies", you probably have a good imagination of what three pennies looks like (or feels), but if I say "one hundred pennies" or peraps even "ten pennies", the image becomes of a large pile of pennies. The individual pennies are not easily handled at those levels mentally. 

This is why we have numbers. We can count out one at a time, or five at a time, or so, and come up with the count of numbers.

Here we discuss the formal aspects of counting. We start with the foundational concept of a set. This is an undefined concept in the approach we are taking as it is the basic starting concept (something has to start undefined). But we can think of them as groups of stuff. There is no implied ordering of items in a set. It is just a collection of items. 

Sets can be joined together in a process called the union. A union consists of all elements in the given set. Unions operate on sets of sets. Intersection is another set concept, but here we form a set of all the common elements.
