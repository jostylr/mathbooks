# Counting

Counting is the the start of mathematics and is something of inherent use to everyone. So let's begin with counting. By the end we will have the notion of a set all nice and understood. 

This is intended for people who already know how to count. It is more of a reflection on counting rather than an introduction which is generally done informally while growing up surrounded by people who count lots of stuff. 

## Humble

What is the core of counting? There are two aspects to it. One is a numbering and one is a sense of more than. 

The numbering starts off by examples. Having one penny, two pennies, three pennies, ..., ten pennies, a hundred pennies, ...  and so on, tells us how many pennies we have. If we had a hundred pennies, we could start removing them and count down to zero, when we have none. 

When I say "three pennies", you probably have a good imagination of what three pennies looks like (or feels), but if I say "one hundred pennies" or peraps even "ten pennies", the image becomes of a large pile of pennies. The individual pennies are not easily handled at those levels mentally. 

This is why we have numbers. We can count out one at a time, or five at a time, or so, and come up with the count of numbers.
